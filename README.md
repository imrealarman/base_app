## Philosophy

Most Flutter starters give you a folder structure and call it a day. **base_app** goes
further: it's opinionated about the things that are tedious to wire up correctly yourself —
per-environment config with validation, feature flags, RTL/LTR, i18n, theming, networking,
testing conventions, git hooks, and CI — so that on day one you're building your product, not
your toolchain.

Every convention here is designed to be **changed, not fought**: a font is one file to swap, an
app rename is one CLI command, a color scheme is a two-line diff. Read [`docs/`](docs/README.md)
for the how-to on every one of them.

## Is this template for you?

✅ You want feature-flagged, multi-environment (dev/staging/prod) builds without hand-rolling
config plumbing.
✅ You want RTL and i18n support from day one, not retrofitted later.
✅ You're comfortable with Riverpod and want its `AsyncValue`/caching model instead of a
separate data-fetching library.
✅ You want git hooks, CI, and testing conventions already decided so the team doesn't debate
them in every PR.

❌ You want a completely blank canvas with zero opinions — this template has plenty.
❌ You need `flutter_bloc`/`get_it`/`auto_route` — this template is Riverpod + go_router, and
mixing state-management paradigms tends to cause more friction than it saves.

## ✨ Features

| | |
|---|---|
| 🎨 **Theming** | [forui](https://forui.dev) design system with light/dark, swap swatches or override brand colors in one file |
| 🔤 **Configurable font** | Drop a `.ttf` into `lib/assets/fonts/app_font.ttf` — no code changes |
| 🌍 **i18n built-in** | Typed, code-generated translations via [slang](https://pub.dev/packages/slang) — English + Persian out of the box |
| ↔️ **RTL/LTR support** | One env var flips the whole app's layout direction |
| 🚦 **Feature flags** | Toggle features per environment via env vars — gates both UI and routing |
| 🌎 **3 environments** | dev/staging/prod, each with its own `.env` file and entrypoint |
| ✅ **Validated config** | Strict-in-CI, lenient-in-dev env validation catches misconfiguration before it ships |
| 🧠 **Riverpod** | Code-gen providers for config, flags, theme, router, and data — no boilerplate |
| 🌐 **Networking** | `dio` + Riverpod `FutureProvider`, with a full worked example feature |
| 🩹 **Typed API errors** | `DioException` mapped to a typed `ApiException` — screens show a specific message per failure kind, not raw exception text |
| 🚨 **Crash reporting hook** | Uncaught errors funnel through one `ErrorReporter.reportError` — wire in Sentry/Crashlytics with a one-line change |
| 🧭 **go_router** | Declarative routing with flag-gated redirects |
| 🏷️ **Rename CLI** | One interactive command renames the app, bundle id, and sets RTL/LTR — with diff preview, backup, and automatic rollback |
| ▶️ **Short run commands** | `dart run tool/cli/run.dart dev\|staging\|prod` instead of typing out `-t lib/main_*.dart` every time |
| 🖼️ **Icon & splash** | Generated from one source image via `flutter_launcher_icons` + `flutter_native_splash` |
| 🧪 **Testing conventions** | `pumpApp` test helper, `mocktail` mocking, widget + unit + integration tests |
| 🪝 **Git hooks** | `lefthook`-powered pre-commit format/analyze + Conventional Commits enforcement |
| 🔄 **CI included** | GitHub Actions: format, analyze, test, coverage |
| 🧩 **Feature-first architecture** | `core/` (cross-cutting) · `features/` (per-feature) · `shared/` (reusable) |

## 🚀 Getting started

```bash
# 1. Create your env files from the template
cp .env.example .env.dev
cp .env.example .env.staging
cp .env.example .env.prod

# 2. Install dependencies and generate code (Riverpod providers + i18n)
flutter pub get
dart run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs

# 3. Run it
flutter run -t lib/main_dev.dart
# ...or the short form:
dart run tool/cli/run.dart dev
```

> The `.env.*` files are gitignored — each developer creates their own from `.env.example`.
> Since they're declared as Flutter assets, the app won't build without them.

> Generated `*.g.dart` files (step 2) are gitignored too, on purpose — committing them causes
> merge conflicts across clones/branches. `lefthook install` (below) sets up hooks that
> regenerate them automatically after a pull or branch switch. See
> [docs/code-generation.md](docs/code-generation.md) for the full rundown of when to rerun
> `build_runner` yourself.

Then, before you ship:

```bash
# Rename the app, set its bundle id, and choose RTL/LTR — interactively, with a diff preview
dart run tool/cli/rename.dart

# Wire up git hooks (format/analyze on commit, Conventional Commits enforcement)
lefthook install
```

## Adding a new feature module

Mirror the structure of `lib/features/posts` (if it talks to an API) or
`lib/features/settings` (if it's pure UI):

1. Create `lib/features/<name>/presentation/<name>_screen.dart` (and `data/` if it fetches data).
2. Add a path constant to `lib/core/router/route_paths.dart`.
3. Register a `GoRoute` for it in `lib/core/router/app_router.dart`.
4. Add translation keys to `lib/i18n/en.i18n.json` and `fa.i18n.json`.
5. Add a widget test under `test/features/<name>/` using the `pumpApp` helper.
